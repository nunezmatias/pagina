# UN Data Clustering

Dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques applied to United Nations data to identify patterns in sustainable development indicators.

## Project Context

Comprehensive analysis of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using advanced machine learning techniques to identify hidden patterns and correlations between countries and regions.

The SDGs represent the most ambitious global agenda for human development and planetary sustainability. However, the complexity of 17 interconnected goals and 247 indicators makes it difficult to identify effective strategies. This project applies data science to reveal patterns that can inform more effective policies.

## Data Sources

### Databases Used

**UN SDG Database** - Official indicators for all 17 SDGs, including metrics for poverty, education, health, gender equality, clean energy, and environmental sustainability.

**World Bank Open Data** - Complementary socioeconomic data providing essential economic and demographic context.

**OECD Statistics** - Development indicators from developed countries for comparative analysis.

**WHO Global Health Observatory** - Detailed public health data complementing SDG health indicators.

### Temporal and Geographic Coverage

**Analysis period**: 2000-2023, capturing both the Millennium Development Goals era and the transition to SDGs.

**Geographic coverage**: 193 UN member states, including small island developing states and least developed countries.

**Indicator granularity**: 247 sustainable development metrics with varying levels of data availability.

## Technical Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

**Intelligent imputation** - Use of KNN algorithms adapted for temporal data, considering geographic and socioeconomic similarities between countries.

**Robust normalization** - Application of Z-score with outlier detection to ensure comparability between indicators with different scales and distributions.

**Dimensionality reduction** - Combination of PCA for linear analysis and t-SNE for visualization of complex non-linear relationships.

### Clustering Algorithms

**Optimized K-Means** - Determination of optimal number of clusters using elbow method and silhouette analysis.

**DBSCAN for outliers** - Identification of countries with unique development patterns that don't fit standard typologies.

**Hierarchical clustering** - Dendrogram analysis to understand nested relationships between country groups.

**Gaussian Mixture Models** - Probabilistic modeling allowing partial membership in multiple clusters.

## Key Results

### Identified Country Typologies

**Sustainable Developed** (23 countries) - Nations like Denmark, Sweden, and Costa Rica that combine high human development with environmental sustainability. Characteristics: HDI > 0.9, controlled per capita emissions, leadership in renewable energy.

**Emerging in Transition** (45 countries) - Economies like China, Brazil, and India with accelerated economic growth but significant environmental challenges. Pattern: rapid urbanization, intensive industrialization, need for energy transition.

**Developing with Potential** (67 countries) - Nations with abundant natural resources but limited infrastructure. Includes many African countries and some Latin American nations. Opportunity: renewable resource-based development.

**Climate Vulnerable** (34 countries) - Small island states and least developed countries with high exposure to extreme climate events. Priority: climate adaptation and resilience.

### Key Correlations Identified

**Education-Health** (r = 0.87) - Very strong correlation confirming the interconnection between these SDGs and suggesting integrated strategies.

**Clean Energy-Emissions** (r = -0.73) - Strong negative correlation validating the importance of energy transition for climate mitigation.

**Gender Equality-GDP per capita** (r = 0.65) - Moderate correlation suggesting that women's empowerment is associated with economic development.

## Tools and Technologies

**Python Ecosystem** - Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computation, Scikit-learn for machine learning.

**Advanced Visualization** - Matplotlib for static graphics, Seaborn for statistical analysis, Plotly for interactive visualizations.

**Distributed Processing** - Apache Spark to handle the massive volume of temporal data from 193 countries.

**Cloud Infrastructure** - Google Cloud Platform for scalability and international collaboration.

## Impact and Applications

### For International Organizations

**Strategic prioritization** - Identification of interventions that can generate the greatest impact across multiple SDGs simultaneously.

**Resource allocation** - Optimization of limited fund distribution based on country typologies and specific needs.

**Intelligent monitoring** - Development of early warning systems for countries deviating from sustainable development trajectories.

### For National Governments

**Intelligent benchmarking** - Comparison with countries of similar characteristics rather than irrelevant global averages.

**Priority identification** - Analysis of which SDGs require immediate attention based on the country's specific profile.

**Policy design** - Empirical evidence for public policies that consider interconnections between different development areas.

## Future Developments

**Satellite integration** - Incorporation of remote sensing data for real-time environmental indicators.

**Predictive models** - Development of algorithms that project progress toward SDGs until 2030 under different scenarios.

**Interactive dashboard** - Creation of visualization tools for decision-makers that allow intuitive data exploration.

## Impact on Public Policy

This analysis has informed development strategies in multiple international organizations and has contributed to a more nuanced understanding of how countries can advance toward sustainable development in effective and contextualized ways.

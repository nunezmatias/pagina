# Matias Núñez Personal Page

This repository contains the source code for a simple static website built with Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js. The original HTML was split into modular files so it can be extended more easily.

## Structure

- `src/index.html` – main page
- `src/css/style.css` – custom Tailwind layers
- `src/js/tailwind-config.js` – Tailwind configuration loaded before the CDN
- `src/js/app.js` – page behaviour and initialisation
- `src/assets/` – place for images or other static resources

To view the page simply open `src/index.html` in your browser.

Feel free to expand the existing files or add new ones to implement extra features.

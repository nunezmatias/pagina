# Chatbot for ALS Communication

AI-based assistive communication system for people with ALS, integrating minimal gesture recognition and natural language generation.

## Project Description

This project develops a revolutionary communication interface for people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), using advanced artificial intelligence technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Main development language
- **TensorFlow** - For machine learning models
- **OpenAI API** - Natural language generation
- **Computer Vision** - Minimal gesture recognition
- **React** - Adaptive user interface

## Main Features

- Recognition of minimal gestures (eye movements, facial expressions)
- Context-based text prediction
- Adaptive interface that adjusts to the user's abilities
- Integration with existing assistive devices
- Continuous learning of the user's communication pattern

## Results and Impact

The system has demonstrated:
- **70% reduction** in the time needed to form sentences
- **95% accuracy** in predicting communicative intentions
- **Significant improvement** in the quality of life of users
- **Adaptability** to different stages of disease progression

## Project Status

Currently in the clinical testing phase with the University Hospital, with plans for implementation in specialized care centers during 2025.

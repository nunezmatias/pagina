# Linguistic Reconstruction with Embeddings

Application of embedding models for the reconstruction and analysis of historical linguistic corpora such as Old English.

## Project Summary

This project uses advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze and reconstruct linguistic patterns in historical texts, with a special focus on the Old English corpus.

## Methodology

### Processing of Historical Corpora
- Digitization and cleaning of medieval manuscripts
- Normalization of spelling variants
- Segmentation and morphological tagging

### Embedding Models
- **Word2Vec** adapted for historical texts
- **BERT** fine-tuned on the Old English corpus
- **Contextual embeddings** to capture semantic evolution

## Implemented Technologies

- **Python** with specialized libraries (NLTK, spaCy)
- **Transformers** (Hugging Face) for pre-trained models
- **Gensim** for training embeddings
- **Medieval Unicode Font Initiative** for character rendering

## Main Results

### Semantic Reconstruction
- Identification of **semantic changes** over 500 years
- Mapping of **etymological relationships** between words
- Prediction of **lost linguistic forms**

### Diachronic Analysis
- Evolution of **semantic fields** (religion, war, agriculture)
- Influence of **Norman French** on the English vocabulary
- Patterns of **linguistic borrowings** from Latin

## Applications

- **Historical lexicography** - Improvement of etymological dictionaries
- **Medieval education** - Tools for students of ancient literature
- **Philological research** - Assistance in the interpretation of texts

## Publications

- "Semantic Evolution in Old English: A Computational Approach" - *Digital Humanities Quarterly* (2024)
- Presentation at the *International Conference on Historical Linguistics* (2024)

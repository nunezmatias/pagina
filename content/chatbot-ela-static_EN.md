# Chatbot for ALS Communication

AI-based assistive communication system for people with ALS, integrating minimal gesture recognition and natural language generation.

## Description

This project develops a revolutionary interface that allows people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis to communicate more efficiently using advanced artificial intelligence.

## Main Features

- **Minimal gesture recognition** - Detects subtle eye and facial movements
- **Intelligent text prediction** - Anticipates words and phrases based on context
- **Adaptive interface** - Automatically adjusts to the user's changing abilities
- **Device integration** - Compatible with existing assistance systems

## Technologies

- Python and TensorFlow for machine learning
- OpenAI API for natural language generation
- Computer Vision for gesture recognition
- React for the user interface

## Impact

The system has been shown to reduce communication time by 70% and significantly improve the quality of life for users.

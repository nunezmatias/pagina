# Remote Sensing Analysis

Physics-based analysis for the interpretation of remote sensing data, with applications in environmental monitoring and natural resource management.

## Project Description

Development of advanced algorithms for the processing and interpretation of satellite data, applying fundamental physical principles to extract precise information about terrestrial environmental processes.

## Physical Foundations

### Electromagnetic Radiation
- **Visible spectrum** (400-700 nm): Vegetation and water bodies
- **Near-infrared** (700-1400 nm): Biomass and soil moisture
- **Thermal infrared** (8000-14000 nm): Surface temperature
- **Microwaves** (1 mm - 1 m): Atmospheric penetration and moisture

### Radiation-Matter Interactions
- **Selective absorption** by different materials
- **Rayleigh scattering** in the atmosphere
- **Mie scattering** by aerosols and clouds
